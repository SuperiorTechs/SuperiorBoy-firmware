- **Control Unit**: Manages all components and facilitates user interaction.
- **Customizable Software and Interfaces**: Provides access to device features and allows integration of development boards and software.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Functions

Superior Boy offers the following core functions:

1. **Bad USB/HID**: Allows the device to inject malicious software into a computer system or act as a Human Interface Device (HID) via a USB connection. This feature assists cybersecurity experts in simulating attacks and detecting vulnerabilities.

2. **Jammer**: Disrupts, blocks, or interferes with wireless communication using the CC1101, NRF24, and ESP32 modules. Useful for assessing network security vulnerabilities.

3. **NFC/RFID Read, Write and Emulator**: Enables interaction with NFC and RFID technologies, allowing users to read, write, and emulate cards. Valuable for testing and improving the security of physical access control systems.

4. **Sub-1 GHz and 2.4 GHz Scanner**: Scans wireless communication devices operating on specific frequencies using the CC1101 and NRF24 modules. Helps evaluate network security and identify specific devices.

5. **WiFi Scanning**: Scans and analyzes Wi-Fi networks, detects nearby networks, identifies vulnerabilities, and conducts security testing. Crucial for cybersecurity assessments and network analysis.

6. **Beacon Spamming**: Broadcasts beacon signals for Bluetooth or other wireless networks, encouraging devices to join specific networks or gain covert access. Useful for testing network security vulnerabilities.

7. **Infrared Transceiver**: Used for infrared communication, allowing transmission and reception of infrared signals.

8. **Playing Basic Games**: Runs basic games for entertainment during breaks or intensive work.

9. **IoT**: Provides access to, management of, and security testing for IoT devices. Useful for evaluating and securing IoT devices.

## ðŸŒŸ Conclusion

In this project, we created Superior Boy using RP2040 and ESP32 microcontrollers, along with components such as CC1101, PN532, NRF24, and IR transceivers. We enhanced the device by adding BMP280, MPU9250, and additional GPIO pins, making it multifunctional. Superior Boy is capable of copying, recording, and replaying wireless communication signals, meeting all the requirements of a cybersecurity expert in a portable device.
